Instructions:

	- Be sure that you have the environment variable SEEDSDK set to the folder where your had installed Seed Framework.
	
			To set SEEDSDK, you need edit the file ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist and add a new string key/value pair:
				key: SEEDSDK
				value: /path/to/sdk
				
			Remember, the SDK folder is the one that will contain the folder "seed", "dependency", "seeddemos" and "seedtools" 
			of a full Seed Framework install.
